## Making Vim Prettier
These are some of the settings to configure Vim to make it look prettier. And then wget atom-dark-256.vim

Inside your .vim directory make a folder named 'colors'
{% highlight ruby %}
cd ~/.vim
mkdir colors
cd colors
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gosukiwi/vim-atom-dark/master/colors/atom-dark-256.vim
#if you do ls you should see the newly installed file
{% endhighlight %}
