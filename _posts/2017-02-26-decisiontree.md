title:  "Predicting Housing Price (Boston Housing Dataset)"

---

This dataset is from scikit-learn library of python. I have used Decision Tree Regressor to decide on the home price. The various features in the dataset used to predict price are:


1. CRIM     per capita crime rate by town       
2. ZN       proportion of residential land zoned for lots over 25,000 sq.ft.
3. INDUS    proportion of non-retail business acres per town
4. CHAS     Charles River dummy variable (= 1 if tract bounds river; 0 otherwise)
5. NOX      nitric oxides concentration (parts per 10 million)
6. RM       average number of rooms per dwelling        
7. AGE      proportion of owner-occupied units built prior to 1940
8. DIS      weighted distances to five Boston employment centres\n        
9. RAD      index of accessibility to radial highways        
10. TAX      full-value property-tax rate per $10,000        
11. PTRATIO  pupil-teacher ratio by town        
12. B        1000(Bk - 0.63)^2 where Bk is the proportion of blacks by town        
18. LSTAT    % lower status of the population
